Haldeman, who died in a plane crash when Elon was a toddler, was an American-born Canadian chiropractor, aviator and political activist in the Technocracy movement[12][13] who moved to South Africa in 1950.[14] Haldeman's anti-government, anti-democratic and conspiracist views, which included the promotion of far-right antisemitic conspiracy theories,[15][16] \"fanatical\" support of apartheid,[16] and according to Errol Musk, support of Nazism,[14] have been suggested as an influence on Elon.[17][18][19][20] During his childhood, Elon was told stories by his grandmother of Haldeman's travels and exploits, and Elon has suggested that all of Haldeman's descendants have his \"desire for adventure, exploration \u2013 doing crazy things\".[21]</p> <p>Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, a younger sister, Tosca, and four paternal half-siblings.[22][23][7][24] Musk was raised in the Anglican Church, in which he was baptized.[25][26] The Musk family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[11] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[11] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines\".[27][28] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[1]</p>"},{"location":"about/childhood/#company","title":"company","text":"<p>tesla</p>"},{"location":"about/childhood/#starlink","title":"starlink","text":"<p>rockets</p>"},{"location":"about/childhood/#heading-test","title":"heading test","text":"<p>relod</p>"},{"location":"about/childhood/#table","title":"table","text":"<p>dfff</p>"},{"location":"about/childhood/#contents","title":"contents","text":""},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/01/31/my-first-blog-post/","title":"my first blog post","text":"<p>Today i learned how t o deploy a documentation site </p>","tags":["MKDcos"]},{"location":"coding/my-first-java-file/","title":"Java","text":""},{"location":"coding/my-first-java-file/#i-learn-java","title":"i learn java","text":"<pre><code>Public class Person {\n            private name = \"thomas wilde\";\n\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/documentation/","title":"Documentation","text":""}]}
