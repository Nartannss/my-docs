# Early life
Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[1][2] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[3][4] His mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[5][6][7] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[8][9][10][11] His maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, who died in a plane crash when Elon was a toddler, was an American-born Canadian chiropractor, aviator and political activist in the Technocracy movement[12][13] who moved to South Africa in 1950.[14] Haldeman's anti-government, anti-democratic and conspiracist views, which included the promotion of far-right antisemitic conspiracy theories,[15][16] "fanatical" support of apartheid,[16] and according to Errol Musk, support of Nazism,[14] have been suggested as an influence on Elon.[17][18][19][20] During his childhood, Elon was told stories by his grandmother of Haldeman's travels and exploits, and Elon has suggested that all of Haldeman's descendants have his "desire for adventure, exploration – doing crazy things".[21]

Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, a younger sister, Tosca, and four paternal half-siblings.[22][23][7][24] Musk was raised in the Anglican Church, in which he was baptized.[25][26] The Musk family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[11] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[11] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive "a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines".[27][28] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[1]
